# utils

Some utilities for Linux and MacOS I have found useful.

* `start` starts something in the background.
* `setup/*.sh` will setup various things on a new machine.
* `setup/all.sh` will execute all the setup/*.sh scripts.

# Usage

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. To setup everything, run `setup/all.sh`
3. You can run individual `setup/*.sh` scripts.
4. If you just want some, `setup/all.sh` with a list of the scripts to run in turn.
